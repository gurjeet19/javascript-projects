# Welcome to My Collection of JavaScript Projects! 

These projects helped me practice and understand different JavaScript concepts, from basic DOM manipulation to working with APIs.

Each project is inside its own folder, and you can check them out individually. Some are small experiments, while others are more complete mini-apps.

##  Why I Made This Repo
I built these projects while learning JavaScript to get hands-on practice. Instead of just watching tutorials, I wanted to build real things and improve my coding skills. Sharing them here so I can track my progress and maybe help others along the way!
